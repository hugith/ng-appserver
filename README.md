# wat?

ng-objects wants to extract the best concepts of Apple's WebObjects framework (WO) and implement it in a new, modern framework.

A secondary goal is to make these applications compatible with WO's deployment environment, so they can transparently integrate into a WO company's existing deployment infrastructure.

While WO compatibility is a large part of this project, we don't want to mimic WO perfectly, but rather learn from and utilize what's happened in the almost two decades of software and web development that's occurred since WO's last official release.

## parts (TODO)

* WO webserver adaptor compatibility
* wotaskd and JavaMonitor compatibility
* More deployment goodies (application lifecycle management)
* Basic Request handling and HTTP apis
* Property loading
* Session management
* Component actions
* Components/Templating/Dynamic elements/Associations
* KVC
* Resource management
